Such Roadtrip helps you create a digital scrapbook of your trip automatically with photos, tweets, and other updates.
Such Roadtrip will automatically organize all of your and your friends&rsquo; activities and plot them on a map in the context of your road trip,
so that you can relive the experience again.

Such Roadtrip was my team's entry to [hackTECH](http://hacktech.io) Winter 2014. We made it to the second round of judging and won an award from [DigitalOcean](www.digitalocean.com)!

The source code for the Android app is [available](https://github.com/sciencepro/Roadtrip-Android) on GitHub.
