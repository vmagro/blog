SC PhotoRun is a photo exploration game designed with the University of Southern California in mind. SC PhotoRun comes with several courses that guide you around campus to visit certain campus landmarks. The game includes achievements and leaderboards for each course, so you can quickly see where you stand among your friends.

PhotoRun is a powerful and extensible platform that can easily be expanded to new locations - universities, museums, theme parks, even entire cities!
