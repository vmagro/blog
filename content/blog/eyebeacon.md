eyeBeacon provides hyperlocal contextual storytelling and payments through Google Glass and Pebble.  
Using Bluetooth LE iBeacons (powered by Raspberry Pi), eyeBeacon provides relevant information about buildings, museum exhibits, and anything else of interest, and allows seamless instant payments through Venmo, all triggered by proximity to a beacon.  
Potential applications include malls, stores, museums, campus tours, and anywhere else that requires location-based contextual information at an intimate level.
